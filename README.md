## üìã Requirements

### Cross-Platform Versions
- Python 3.6+
- Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux
- No additional packages required (uses only Python standard library)

### Windows-Specific Versions
- Python 3.6+
- Windows 10 or later (for ANSI color support)
- Uses Windows-specific optimizations

## üöÄ Usage

### Cross-Platform (Windows/macOS/Linux)
```bash
# Run any toy directly
python bouncing_ball.py
python clock.py
python snake.py
python matrix_rain.py
# ... etc
```

### Windows-Specific Versions
```cmd
# Run Windows-optimized versions
cd windows
python bouncing_ball.py
python clock.py
python fire.py
# ... etc
```

### Examples:
```bash
# Cross-platform versions (work everywhere)
python bouncing_ball.py
python clock.py
python snake.py
python matrix_rain.py

# Windows-specific versions (Windows only)
python windows\bouncing_ball.py
python windows\clock.py
python windows\fire.py
python windows\game_2048.py
python windows\paint.py
python windows\life.py
python windows\tictactoe.py
python windows\pipes.py
python windows\tetris.py
python windows\snake.py
python windows\matrix_rain.py
```

## üåü Features

- **Cross-platform support**: Main versions work on Windows, macOS, and Linux
- **Colorful**: All animations use ANSI colors for a vibrant experience
- **No dependencies**: Uses only Python standard library
- **Keyboard controls**: Responsive keyboard input handling
- **Single file**: Each toy is self-contained in a single Python file

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Colors not working?
- **Windows**: Make sure you're using Windows 10 or later, or try Windows Terminal
- **macOS/Linux**: Most modern terminals support ANSI colors by default

### Game crashes on startup?
- Check Python version: `python --version` (should be 3.6+)
- Make sure terminal_utils.py is in the same directory for cross-platform versions
- Try the Windows-specific versions if on Windows

### Arrow keys not working on macOS/Linux?
- Make sure your terminal emulator properly sends escape sequences
- Try using WASD keys as an alternative (where supported)

## üîß Technical Details

The cross-platform versions use a `terminal_utils.py` module that handles:
- Platform detection
- Cross-platform keyboard input (using `msvcrt` on Windows, `termios` on Unix)
- Screen clearing and cursor control
- ANSI color support

Windows-specific versions are optimized with:
- Direct `msvcrt` usage for faster input
- Windows console API features
- Optimized screen clearing

## üéâ Enjoy!

Have fun playing with these terminal toys! Feel free to modify and extend them as you like. Each one is designed to be simple enough to understand and modify while being fun to play with.
